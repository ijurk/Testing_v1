Other Free Data Resources
Placeholder to share details of other free financial data sources not included in the lecture videos.

I will keep updating/adding links and the corresponding python codes as I come across these sources. Special shout out to Reza Sadeghi for recommending these great free resources.



1) Financialmodelingprep.com – Excellent resource to get stock information and financial information of US stocks. Also provides key ratios, DCF etc.

Please refer code fmp.py for extracting financial data programmatically. Above link also has sample codes.



2) Stockrow.com – Provides financial information, key stats, historical data on ratios etc. Also provides a very good screener



Please refer code stockrow.py (created by Reza and reviewed by me) for extracting financial data programmatically.
